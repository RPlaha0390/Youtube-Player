# YoutubePlayer

## App
	The Youtube Player app uses the Youtube API to retrieve all videos. The app uses a GET Request to retrieve the data from the API, and jQuery to publish videos to the front end.
	The app allows you to open the videos in a modal pop up. For this we have used the jQuery Fancybox plugin, installed via Bower. Enjoy!
